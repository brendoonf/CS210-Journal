Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

I was tasked to create a program that would input whatever time the user wanted, and then display two clocks on the screen, one in 12-hour format, and one in 24-hour format. Then, I had to give the user 4 options in a menu that being add 1 hour, add 1 minute, add one second, or exit program. 


What did you do particularly well?

This was the first project of the whole semester, so C++ was still very new to me and until this project, I hadn't had to create a program from scratch. The week this project was due was also the same week that we learned about functions, and the program required several of them. I would say that for a first timer, I implemented these functions into the program well and made it easy to understand and edit.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

One issue I had with my program is that when it asked the user if they wanted the 12-hour clock to display A.M. or P.M., their choice would be permanent, no matter how many hours or minutes they added once they entered the time. I tried to fix this problem, but I was too inexperienced to figure it out.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging part was getting the clocks to reset once the time got past 12 or 24, as well as making the minutes reset and then add an hour if they were adding minutes, and so on for if they were adding seconds. I remember scowering the internet in search for help but in the end, I actually managed to figure it out for myself.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I think the overall flow of the code was very easy to read and follow, which is definitely a valuabe skill to be able to do when working on much bigger projects. That will definitely be something that follows me to other programs.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I did my best to seperate the code functionality into functions, as well as try not to have several parts of the code repeating.
